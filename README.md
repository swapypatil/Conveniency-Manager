# Convenient-Manager
Convenient Manager is simple Java Swing based application that provides various utilities to be accessed on single click. The utilities include Control Panel, VM Ware, Firewall enable/disable, Disk drives access, Chrome, Firefox, Get IP address. This application makes use of bat files.

The path of the bat files may get changed when you clone or download, if the problem occurs, store files at your Desktop(because I stored the repository locally at my Desktop). If you want to change the location then you need to change the paths in ConvenientManager.java as well.

If the same problem persist or multiple command prompt start opening, then use Alt + F4 multiple times to close those command prompt windows. Now the problem is with your actual bat files. Now check the bat files and modify accordingly.(e.g. For Chrome/Firefox check their respective path in C drive and modify the path in respective bat file).
